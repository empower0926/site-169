They spoke about maximalism, helping the community, fiat against crypto, the crypto market future, capitalism and a new mindset and system.</p>\\n<p><strong>A better future with cryptocurrencies and blockchain</strong><br />\\nAsked by Mru Patel how does he see the crypto market really going, Borck Pierce answered:</p>\\n<blockquote><p>“I have a positive outlook. I’m a believer, obviously. I believe in cryptocurrencies, I believe in blockchain technology, I think that these things are the future and they are going to change the world for the better. In what time frame, in what version, what shape or form, I don’t know.”</p></blockquote>\\n<p>When it comes to cryptocurrencies and blockchain, Brock Pierce said that he is looking at the world of tomorrow for its future potential, not the world as it is today. The Presidential candidate believes that people have the power to create together a better future and a better world, and he encourages people not to close their minds.</p>\\n<p><strong>Evolution, not revolution</strong><br />\\nBrock Pierce’s view on the adoption of blockchain and cryptocurrencies is the following:</p>\\n<blockquote><p>“I know that I would like to see this be an evolutionary event for humanity, not a revolutionary event for humanity. Revolutions involve anger and hate, and they often end up being chaotic and violent. I would like to see an evolutionary event, where the old and the new win together. I want us to create win-win scenarios.”</p></blockquote>\\n<p>Brock Pierce compares maximalism with religious fundamentalism and believes that maximalism is associated with the token you hold and advices people to diversify and hedge.</p>\\n<blockquote><p>“This business is too big. I’m ex-Sun Microsystems, so even in the early days we created this thing called Java One and Sun One, where we brought every person out there, even competitors, in the same room and said work with each other, because you cannot be the best working alone,”</p></blockquote>\\n<p>added Mru Patel on the same topic.</p>\\n<p>To find out more about Brock’s opinion on blockchain, crypto and other hot topics, watch the video below for the full fireside chat.</p>\\n<p><iframe width=\\\"711\\\" height=\\\"400\\\" src=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/WbNeDzyYcAo\\\" frameborder=\\\"0\\\" allow=\\\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\\\" allowfullscreen=\\\"\\\"></iframe></p>\\n\",\"protected\":false},\"excerpt\":{\"rendered\":\"<p>Brock Pierce, well-known crypto venture capitalist and currently independent candidate for U.S. President, sat down for a fireside chat with Mru Patel, Partner and COO of Flash Group and CEO of Sapian Capital.

It also is cold storage, a feature that ensures safety of fiat and crypto currencies&#8217; wallets     Remittance services (FlashRemitt) allowing instant transfer of crypto/fiat currencies     Exchange platform (FlashXchanger) for cryptocurrencies and 180 fiat currencies\\n</ul>\\n<p>In addition to Flashmoni&#8217;s tools, the company offers two gold-backed tokens at the center of its financial ecosystem:</p>\\n<p>    OZG is a private, non-tradable token directly backed by physical 24k gold that will be stored in a depository and audited quarterly by an independent and internationally known audit firm. This is a security coin that will not be available to the public, but ensures the system&#8217;s stability.<br />\\n    OZTG is a tradable utility token backed by OZG, meaning its core value is also backed by gold. It is available to the public and will be found on exchanges including <a href=\\\"https://www.flashxchanger.com/\\\" rel=\\\"noopener noreferrer\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">FlashXchanger</a>.\\n</ul>\\n<p>OZG&#8217;s value is equivalent to 1 grain of gold, or about 0.065 grams, and will not fluctuate with market movements, as it is not available on public exchanges. OZTG&#8217;s price will fluctuate based on trading, however, its price will never fall below 1/20 of OZG&#8217;s value. Unlike the majority of tokens on the market, OZT has a core value because it is backed by the amount of gold the company has stored.</p>\\n<p>During Phase 1 of Flashmoni&#8217;s crowdsale, the company raised $62 million U.S. Dollars. There are still approximately 141 million OZT tokens remaining, with a hard cap of $100 million.</p>\\n<p>Flashmoni will be able to keep rates and fees low by focusing on its advertising solution as its primary generator of revenue. Its blockchain advertising solution (FlashAdChain) boasts smart contracts and ensures fully transparent advertising rates.</p>\\n<p>Flashmoni is based in Lisbon with offices in London, Singapore and Dubai. Prior to launching its ICO, the Flashmoni&#8217;s leadership team bootstrapped the initial development of the company and its solutions, unique in the ICO-space. The ICO is closed to general investors in the U.S.</p>\\n<p>About Flashmoni<br />\\nFlashmoni is a blockchain company built for financial inclusion. As part of its comprehensive financial ecosystem, it provides banking solutions to everyone in the global community – most importantly the unbanked and underbanked. Flashmoni&#8217;s ecosystem can be divided into three essential components: Cryptocurrency tokens, tools for the unbanked/underbanked and advertising solutions. Specifically, it offers a utility gold-backed token and its tools include physical crypto ATMs, multi-currencies digital wallets, a fiat and cryptocurrency exchange platform, a smart-card used for payments and remittance services. Additionally, Flashmoni has created an advertising solution featuring smart contracts, which serves as its primary source of revenue and allows it to keep fees and costs at a minimum.</p>\\n<p>For the original version on PRWeb visit: http://www.prweb.com/releases/2018/04/prweb15399228.htm</p>\\n\",\"protected\":false},\"excerpt\":{\"rendered\":\"<p>Flashmoni&#8217;s financial ecosystem set to include several services for unbanked and underbanked, Company raised $62 million USD in phase one.
