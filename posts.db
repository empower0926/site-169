The topic was “The DeFi Phenomenon,” speaking alongside the well-known <a href=\\\"https://tonevays.com/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">Tone Vays</a>, who is a former Wall Street trader and vice president of JP Morgan Chase, currently an expert in economic trends, trading, risk analysis and cryptocurrency.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The online event was moderated by Sergey Sevantsyan and Catherine Ross and was centred on the decentralised field: defying decentralisation as phenomena, what the value of decentralisation is and what the bad side of <a href=\\\"https://flashgroupnews.com/2020/11/06/person-to-person-finance-is-no-new-concept-but-now-is-seen-as-the-future/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">decentralisation </a>is.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>“Decentralisation happened when dot-com really happened. Global online trading started all together. It didn’t matter where you were, people wanted to buy or sell a product from any part of the world, using all the main things that are currently being disrupted. So, when that started, the power to the people was not there. The banks controlled the exchange rates, the GDP and all the rest of it,” said <a href=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/MT7Yl9335iU\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">Mru Patel</a>. “Now, we are in a world where Bitcoin was the pioneer of decentralisation, currency and specifically cryptocurrency. So the money part of internet-based trading was lacking, because everyone was still doing fiat transactions, and they were dependent on bank transfers and other services like PayPal. Hence, with Bitcoin, what we now got was power to the people,” continued Mru Patel.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>According to him, in a decentralised space, coins are not valued by a centralised government and they don’t depend on GDP, banking or government based pricing, the gold that countries have in their reserves. People have got the taste of decentralisation and they’ve seen how the tax paying citizen is always at the mercy of governments and banks that pursue political agendas, regardless of how it affects the citizens.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>“I’m not saying decentralised exchanges are bad, but we are not there yet. If you look at some of the decentralised exchanges that have been hacked, at least you can point a finger at who’s lost your money. In a decentralised scenario, you won’t be able to get your money back immediately and don’t know who to point the finger to. So it’s still evolving. Decentralised finance, whilst it’s happening, basic business fundamentals don’t exist. All of these are developing. Same with the decentralised television, advertising, media market and tokenisation of assets – so many of these things are happening. So, in my view, these markets are so huge, that they will be disrupted in a decentralised manner,” pointed out Mru Patel.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In his view, the main reason people want to do decentralised finance in the post ICO era is because they’ve all had enough of middlemen like governments, authorities, brokers and banks taking cuts. It’s a huge market size, as 90% of people trade online now.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>“The internet is decentralised. However, the things that happen on the internet are generally centralised. We can look at something like even the news. The news traveling around is decentralised, but I think honestly that we’re seeing more fake news and brainwashing of people than ever before. You would think that the internet would resolve that, but it feels that it’s only getting worse. So, there is no actual decentralisation of the media, is just the way that information is spread,” highlighted Tone Vays.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>“When we come into the crypto space, I don’t believe DeFi exists. I don’t believe there is anything decentralised in what is referred to as DeFi, other than Bitcoin. Bitcoin actually pulled off that it’s decentralised. But all of these other projects in the world of DeFi, they all have a centralised point of failure. I believe every cryptocurrency, since Bitcoin, has a centralised point of failure. Now some are a lot easier to attack than others. And we don’t know how easy it is to attack them until it happens, and it has been happening more and more,” added Tone Vays.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>According to him, the moment there is an interaction in the physical world there’s no such thing as decentralisation. Futures contracts cannot be decentralised, as most of them involve an exchange over good such as gold, soybeans, corn. The only one that is not in this category is a future’s contract on the S&amp;P 500, because that’s not a physical thing, it’s a collection of numbers and a database like stocks. The same would happen with a future on Bitcoin.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>“Perhaps it’s possible to build a decentralised piece of code that will allow you to exchange one virtual currency for another virtual currency. But that is where decentralisation ends. But why do we need multiple decentralised currencies? We actually don’t,” added Tone Vays.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>He further said that there’s no need for multiple decentralised currencies, only one is enough, the same way there’s only one internet. Even though it could be decentralisation in <a href=\\\"https://flashgroupnews.com/2020/10/19/internet-blockchain-icos-defi-dao-what-next/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">DeFi</a>, he actually questions the decentralisation part in DeFi.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>“In an ideal world, there will always be a mix between centralisation and decentralisation, because even in the DAO movement, someone somewhere is controlling the DAO function. Same with <a href=\\\"https://flashgroupnews.com/2020/10/14/what-is-the-future-centralised-finance-cefi-or-decentralised-finance-defi/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">CEX </a>vs. DEX. Even in the decentralised exchanges, someone somewhere is controlling it. So there’ll always be a match and a balance of which bits can be centralised and which bits cannot be centralised,” said Mru Patel.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>“Replacing a trusted middleman with trusted code has been incredibly dangerous over the last five years, as we have learned. That has not yet proven to actually be a better solution. Maybe it will be in the future, and the one thing that bothers me in the space is that no one wants to move slow. I know there’s this model in Silicon Valley <em>move fast and break things</em>, but that should not apply to holding other people’s money. That’s usually applied to a piece of technology, not a person’s potential life savings,” said Tone Vays.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>According to him, the mentality of <em>move fast and break things </em>is unethical and dangerous for the crypto space, when it comes to holding on to people’s money, and it reflects badly on everyone.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>“We took some of these lessons and said what’s the middle ground. On our exchange, which is going to be out soon, we give the user the choice of where he wants to keep his money, because money is a very sensitive thing. So when you trade on the exchange with real coins, we give the user the choice: do you want to store it on your Taser, Ledger or your own Crypto Vault, or even in your own secure server somewhere. So we give them the choice of custodial, which is very important. The same with the wallet,” said Mru Patel.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Sergey Sevantsyan asked what the value of decentralisation is for Tone Vays, who answered as follows:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>“For me, it’s the decentralisation of money. And I know it sounds scary that we could potentially be moving into a world with a single global currency… It’s assumed that the one world money would be created by the one world government. But Bitcoin gave people the ability to have one global money, without the need for one global government.”</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In Tone Vays’ view, Bitcoin is one of the greatest innovations of all time, alongside internet. Also, according to Mru Patel, Bitcoin is one of the biggest digital money provider, and the fuel to the internet, however, there will be other variations, just like the internet has intranets. Community-based coins and loyalty-based coins pegged or stable in some way are the future, that’s why certain countries are doing their own CBDCs. People do not want to be monitored by governments that police what they buy, sell or transfer money to friends, family and businesses. Worse still people do not want to be told you are spending too much in USA or China due to country based politics and ban citizens from using their money how they want. The only key thing that matters is the money laundering, source of funds and KYC laws.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Asked by Catherine Ross what the bad side of decentralisation is, Tone Vays answered:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>“To me, the ugly side of it might be slightly different than what a lot of people would expect. Sure, we’ve seen a lot of bad actors use the technology, but that happens all around the world. Bad people use the internet. Bad people use cars. I don’t see decentralisation being bad for the world because bad people will chose to use it, and unfortunately that is how the government is looking at it. To me, the ugly side of it is the fact that there are bad people actually building the technology. Whether they’re maliciously bad because they know they’re building something just to enrich themselves and they don’t care who they scam to do it, or they’re technologically incompetent to build this kind of technology, while making themselves sound like they are technologically competent. I also don’t necessarily trust their ability to build this technology.”</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>“If it’s your own money, would you give it to that person without knowing it? The ICO days, even though most were bad, they were better than the DeFi space, where in 90% of the cases, you don’t even see who the people behind are. You don’t see their business fundamentals, business case or a whitepaper. They are just doing tokens for profiteering, but you can’t change bad people. It’s in any industry. In the traditional industry, you see how many people are doing money laundry using paper money. However we, especially the big thought leaders and influencers out there, need to call some of these people out when they’re doing something wrong. There are so many of these specific DeFi tokens who haven’t got a clue about how to manage money, let alone building any business sustainability or put their name and face on their token. These are the people I would say please stay away from,” added Mru Patel.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Tone Vays said that social media, as private platforms, should be able to take down bad things. As long as they are not politically biased and they are not following a personal agenda, they should have clear guidelines. In his view, the biggest threat of social media is the fact that it allows government entities to spy on their own citizens. When it comes to Google, they can only advertise to people, but the bad part is handing the information to people that can actually do harm.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>“We don’t have a decentralised world. Our consciousness is not in the digital realm, our consciousness is in the physical realm. So the only thing we can rely on is the laws of the foundation of your nation. Those laws need to be protected, and we’re not seeing that basically anywhere in the world unfortunately. Some regions are freer than others, when it comes to finance, but basically, at the moment, it may look that there’s no hope, but hopefully there will be enough encryption and it won’t get banned. Once people get their privacy back and once people have a decentralised money (Bitcoin), maybe the world will change and the elites will just have to adapt to the new world. Or we really need the right people in government to protect people’s privacy, and we just haven’t seen that unfortunately,” said Tone Vays.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Mru Patel pointed out that governments don’t understand decentralisation, as they don’t have the right skills to do it. He suggested that people should have ownership of their data and money under some form of regulation on the digital banking organisations that offer the exchanges and wallets.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>“Governments should really focus to make sure people’s personal data and personal money are protected in some way, rather than just trusting a bunch of bad actors or bad code. It’s based on that trust,” said Mru Patel. “People want the power. I want to keep my control over my finance, that’s why I call it personalised finance,” concluded Mru Patel.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>To watch the full online event, click <a href=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctmWel-S4qo\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">here </a>or on the video below.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\\\"wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\\\"><div class=\\\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\\\">\\n<iframe title=\\\"Decentralised Finance Global Summit - The DeFi Phenomenon\\\" width=\\\"696\\\" height=\\\"392\\\" src=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ctmWel-S4qo?feature=oembed&#038;enablejsapi=1\\\" frameborder=\\\"0\\\" allow=\\\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\\\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\\n</div></figure>\\n\",\"protected\":false},\"excerpt\":{\"rendered\":\"<p>Author: Georgiana Dogaru Keynote: Decentralised Finance Global Summit &#8211; The DeFi Phenomenon Event: Decentralied Finance Global Summit Mru Patel, Partner and CEO of Sapian Group, Partner and COO of Flash Group, was a keynote speaker at the online event Decentralied Finance Global Summit.

I’m a believer, obviously. I believe in cryptocurrencies, I believe in blockchain technology, I think that these things are the future and they are going to change the world for the better. In what time frame, in what version, what shape or form, I don’t know.”</p></blockquote>\\n<p>When it comes to cryptocurrencies and blockchain, Brock Pierce said that he is looking at the world of tomorrow for its future potential, not the world as it is today. The Presidential candidate believes that people have the power to create together a better future and a better world, and he encourages people not to close their minds.</p>\\n<p><strong>Evolution, not revolution</strong><br />\\nBrock Pierce’s view on the adoption of blockchain and cryptocurrencies is the following:</p>\\n<blockquote><p>“I know that I would like to see this be an evolutionary event for humanity, not a revolutionary event for humanity. Revolutions involve anger and hate, and they often end up being chaotic and violent. I would like to see an evolutionary event, where the old and the new win together. I want us to create win-win scenarios.”</p></blockquote>\\n<p>Brock Pierce compares maximalism with religious fundamentalism and believes that maximalism is associated with the token you hold and advices people to diversify and hedge.</p>\\n<blockquote><p>“This business is too big. I’m ex-Sun Microsystems, so even in the early days we created this thing called Java One and Sun One, where we brought every person out there, even competitors, in the same room and said work with each other, because you cannot be the best working alone,”</p></blockquote>\\n<p>added Mru Patel on the same topic.</p>\\n<p>To find out more about Brock’s opinion on blockchain, crypto and other hot topics, watch the video below for the full fireside chat.</p>\\n<p><iframe width=\\\"711\\\" height=\\\"400\\\" src=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/WbNeDzyYcAo\\\" frameborder=\\\"0\\\" allow=\\\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\\\" allowfullscreen=\\\"\\\"></iframe></p>\\n\",\"protected\":false},\"excerpt\":{\"rendered\":\"<p>Brock Pierce, well-known crypto venture capitalist and currently independent candidate for U.S. President, sat down for a fireside chat with Mru Patel, Partner and COO of Flash Group and CEO of Sapian Capital.

Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) have also become the centre of attention in the last few months. According to the technical definition, fungibility is the interchangeability of a real world good or asset with another individual good or asset of the same type. For example, if you burrow a $10 note, you will pay back most probably with a different $10 note, or you could do it even with two $5 notes. On the other hand, non-fungible assets have specific characteristics. The 3 main ones are:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul><li>Uniqueness with a permanent unalterable record</li><li>Scarcity and rareness in availability</li><li>Indivisibility</li></ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>NFTs with such characteristics could gain their value through that uniqueness. For example, a plane ticket is unique. Even though it may look the same, it has different destinations, names, class, seat number, etc. One ticket may send you to New York first class, another one may be a trip to Milwaukee in economy. The same applies to a piece of art or collectible unique card.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>“With my interest in music and artists, I see the NFTs could offer a very tangible benefit to the artists in protecting their IPR, whilst creating a specific token for them and their music. In this way, if all artists list their IPR based assets, they would protect themselves from the usual bootlegging related issues, currently experienced via the various torrent sites. However, the major benefit comes from being paid immediately rather than waiting for record companies or streaming ones like Spotify, who pay you annually,” commented <a href=\\\"https://lobreauserge.com/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">Serge Maurice Lobreau</a>, Chairman and Founder of <a href=\\\"https://sapiangroup.com/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">Sapian Group</a> and of <a href=\\\"https://flashgroup.io/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">Flash Group</a>.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>Non-fungible tokens might be the next hot thing in crypto</strong></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Last few months, <a href=\\\"https://flashgroupnews.com/2020/11/12/the-defi-phenomenon-value-benefits-and-negative-aspects/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">DeFi</a> has taken the industry by a storm. However, NFTs have taken a major lead as the way forward for a token, that can be used for anything that is distinct and unique in features. Non-fungible tokens are digital collectibles,&nbsp;usually linked&nbsp;to&nbsp;a specific asset. They are tokenised versions of assets, similar to stablecoins, but not entirely the same. Unlike Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies, which have a supply of a certain number of identical coins, NFTs have individual characteristics that make them unique. They are used to represent a variety of non-fungible assets such as real estate, digital artwork, virtual collectibles, event tickets, gaming, virtual assets, real world assets, and much more.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Non-fungible tokens are cryptographic tokens that can’t be replicated, can’t be counterfeited, can’t be printed on demand and they have ownership guarantees as Bitcoin. They are different from the typical cryptocurrencies, as they are unique, rare and indivisible. They can be used to prove the ownership of digital items or physical assets like a unique authentication certificate for a piece of art, or limited edition of watches, or music records. Other tokens are fungible, in the same way as coins or banknotes, hence fungible tokens are interchangeable, the same way as a US dollar note, while non-fungible tokens can’t be replaced by something identical. NFTs cannot be split into smaller denominations, hence it is not possible to send a fraction of an NFT, the same way you would do with a fungible token.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>NFT – a dream or history in the making?</strong></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The NFT market is already $400 million, and projected to increase by 50% by the end of 2020 in value. However, the estimation is not even by far as crazy as the growth of the <a href=\\\"https://flashgroupnews.com/2020/10/14/what-is-the-future-centralised-finance-cefi-or-decentralised-finance-defi/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">DeFi</a> sector in 2020, from $665 million to $4.2 billion. NFTs have the potential to fuel an even bigger growth of the DeFi space. The technology and platforms that bring real life assets into this ecosystem already exist and they are running. This way, new people and businesses will come into the crypto ecosystem. NFTs can solve many issues that are now in many industries. Thus, digital and real-life assets can be easy to transfer, while buyers can have proof of ownership and authenticity, offering the certainty that what they get is what they paid for.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>“We’ve just started to see the amazing effects of DeFi tokens, where the vast majority have had similar drops like in the ICO days of over 70% already, like most startups do. In the NFT world, the price of the token based on the uniqueness of the token, its rareness and potential gain due to its limited supply gives ownership of the asset to the client. At Sapian Group, we are developing an extremely unique NFT that not only meets these criteria, but also combines the benefits of DeFi and yield farming in particular. Watch this space for more news on the already developed extension to the Masternode staking rewards program recently launched. We believe NFTs can unlock even more opportunities within our existing ecosystem,” commented Mru Patel, CEO and Partner at Sapian Group and COO and Partner at Flash Group.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>NFT use cases</strong></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>ERC-721 are non-fungible tokens, while ERC-1155 combines the benefits of fungible and non-fungible tokens together. The most popular applications for NFTs include virtual games like CryptoKitties and Decentraland. However, it’s already being tried at an early stage in the insurance and financial sector as well. A lot of the major thought leaders in the space have said that financial primates such as borrowing, landing, yield generation and insurance are usually performed by locking, staking, depositing and using as collateral the ERC-20 tokens like YFI, Dai, Link, Land, to name a few. But let’s get into even more ways that non-fungible tokens can be used.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>Art and entertainment</strong></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>For example, art is a major domain where NFTs would make a great difference. It’s not easy for digital artists to protect their copyright, but blockchain ends that nightmare and makes art one of the most popular applications for NFTs. It also offers proof of ownership for the buyers and makes the whole process simpler. Digital art auctions are more and more common, with paintings that were sold at spectacular prices. NFTs can also protect filmmakers and musicians against copyright infringement and connect artists directly with consumers through blockchain-based payment solutions.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>Collectibles</strong></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Collectibles have the highest sales volume on NFTs. For example, CryptoKitties, a game where users breed and collect digital cats, is one of the largest NFT-collectible projects in terms of sales volume since 2017. The Dragon CryptoKittie still holds the record for the most expensive non-fungible token ever sold. She was worth 600 ETH, representing $170.000 at the time of sale. Cryptopunks, another collectible NFT, was one of the earliest ones created that goes for a fortune. New types of collectibles are created through NFTs, such as tokenised versions of celebrities or sports stars, but real-world items like stamps or coins are also tokenised.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>Gaming</strong></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Gaming is a massive market of 2.5 billion players. NFTs are a popular trend in gaming, as blockchain allows players to gain ownership of their in-game items and enables them to earn real money by playing their favourite games. Blockchain games have become more and more popular, especially after the COVID-19 lockdown, and people continue to embrace blockchain games. Gods Unchained is a pioneer in trading card games, which is a simple yet very powerful in game trading card, with a use case that holds different powers within a game. Games like Six Dragons, Age of Rust are now long awaited for such reasons of use cases that could bring massive adoption.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>Why are we the most secure and Unique Financial NFT in the making on the market?</strong></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>“Sapian Group, with all its subsidiaries, are exploring ways to create a unique NFT that capitalises on such use cases and increases the utility of its OZTG coin, as well as the OZeety <a href=\\\"https://flashgroupnews.com/2020/11/01/an-insight-into-blockchain-and-asset-pegged-technologies-interview-with-serge-maurice-lobreau/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">blockchain</a>. We bring the best of breed from all past investment experiences of the partners namely banking, wealth management, property investment, fund management, crypto currency, blockchain, DeFi and NFT,” summarised Serge Maurice Lobreau.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>“What we have is an established <a href=\\\"https://flashgroupnews.com/2020/08/20/i-think-that-cryptocurrencies-and-blockchain-are-the-future-brock-pierce/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">blockchain</a> that already demonstrates such key characteristics of NFTs like real world assets, uniqueness with pool of Masternodes for ownership, a utility token and ecosystem&nbsp; model with growing base of a community, rarity as Masternodes will not be available forever, as ownership is indivisible, to name a few key market differentiators. However, with our total ecosystem of products and services, we are in the process of creating an even more unique super NFT that will be something of a gamechanger. It will bring the best of DeFi, crypto, blockchain, yield farming and a much bigger use case side of our core business,” concluded Mru Patel.</p>\\n\",\"protected\":false},\"excerpt\":{\"rendered\":\"<p>Author: Georgiana Dogaru Decentralised finance (DeFi) has been the talk of the town throughout 2020, but it wasn’t the only sector in the space that gained traction.

Concurrent with the answer is a question about the nature of the growth opportunities, and both Daryl Guppy and Mru Patel expressed their views, vision and predictions on what will happen globally with the digital economy after the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>“COVID-19 has underlined the irresistible and accelerated growth in digital industries. This goes beyond settlement platforms. It includes logistics delivery services, customer service and a new awareness of access to global consumer choice. Economies will be restored, but the new digital shape will not disappear. Dispersed offices and working from home are set to become a permanent feature of the economic landscape,” said Daryl Guppy.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>“I totally agree with that. The COVID-19 pandemic has reshaped the society in many ways. It has shown that we can work remotely in various areas, which proved to be more productive for so many people. Personally, I have been in the work from home culture since the late 1990’s at Sun Microsystems. We waste less time traveling from home to work and certainly to global events and meetings, often just for a face to face based interaction. Business meetings, conferences and events are now happening through Zoom, with entrepreneurs wasting less time traveling, cutting the dead time spent in airports and on flights. There’s a new way of doing business and that will be the way forward,” expressed his view Mru Patel.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>“Who sets the protocol standards for digital connectivity? These standards include blockchain, artificial intelligence, digital currency, distributed ledgers and other arcane but critical parts of the digital economy. Without collectively developed and agreed policies, the digital economy would fracture into incompatible fortresses. Currently, governments are using crude tools to deal with the global digital revolution. The headlines include security, legislative control and intervention in the ability to complete financial transactions,” said Daryl Guppy.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>“Progress can only happen if it’s allowed to happen, on any level, including in the digital space. Governments have a tradition in stifling innovation, but maybe this time will be different, as we’ve all witnessed the benefits of technology innovation during difficult times. We need proper legislation if we want to see a real digital revolution. Technology innovators need support from the Governments in order to implement new technologies that will make transactions more secure, faster and less expensive. But we know traditional financial institutions don’t like these changes, so the challenge is quite big. We need a global legislation to create the proper framework for technology changes, especially in the digital currency and exchanges space,” added Mru Patel.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>“The potential for digital growth is the key investment question. The Datareportal Global Digital overview estimates the U.S., with a current online population of 263 million, has the potential to add another 39 million. That&#8217;s a 14 percent growth. China has a population of 838 million internet users with the potential to add another 583 million. That&#8217;s a growth potential of 69 percent, offering more opportunity both in raw numbers and in percentage growth terms. Investors, software developers, businesses and companies are all moving rapidly towards an inflection point. The potential 69 percent growth in the Chinese digital economy is a more powerful driver than the 14 percent growth in the U.S. Rather than leave agreement on global standards to chance and Twitter tantrum, it is essential that business demands a global agreement on ground rules for digital transformation. It&#8217;s a process that calls for leadership from technology companies and the investors who support them because otherwise, access to growth opportunities will remain elusive,” concluded Daryl Guppy.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>“Also, let’s not forget about my birthplace of Africa, residence in Europe and Indian origin nations. Currently, the number of internet users in India is 696 million. Even though nearly 700 million people are still not connected, the number of the digital population in India is quite high, so the potential for digital growth is high as well. There are so many software developers and IT people in India, and also two of the world’s biggest technology companies – Google and Microsoft – are led by Indian-origin CEOs. So the potential for the Indian market to grow is there. Also, Europe has a population of internet users of around 445 million people, while the world has 4.57 billion active internet users. As for Africa, as a born Kenyan, it’s great to see that over 87% of the population is connected, but more importantly payment systems via the mobile is an established business for even the small fruit and vegetable hawkers just like China, albeit at very high transaction costs. The rest of Africa has a huge potential, where there are several countries with over 80% of unconnected population. With the advent of 5G and lower cost devices, this will explode in such countries. Thus, digital transformation needs a global legislation that encourages innovation. That way, more people can have access to internet and transform their lives from simple things like watching a movie on Netflix to important things like access to digital banking and investments that lead to financial growth,” said Mru Patel.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>“It is clear which market offers more opportunities. However, the thought of two very different digital standards makes the idea of one digital product for multiple markets difficult to implement. And the discussion of essential policy standards has been side-tracked by a national security debate,” added Daryl Guppy.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>“National security is very important, thus the policy makers need to create the right environment for growth and transformation in a safe manner. COVID-19 has shown us how important technology is and nobody can deny anymore its crucial role in our society. Investors can access growth, while unbanked and underbanked population can have access to financial services through digital banking. Working from home is not a trend, it’s something that most probably will become the new normal for many employees and entrepreneurs. In this horrid situation, there is a silver lining, and our society is reshaping, allowing technology to be the change the whole society needs,” concluded Mru Patel.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Daryl Guppy is an international financial technical analysis expert and author of books on stock market trading techniques.

This way, he managed his time more effectively and focused his energy to move forward the <a href=\\\"https://sapiangroup.com/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">Sapian Group</a> and <a href=\\\"https://flashgroup.io/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">Flash Group</a>’s innovative and disruptive project.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>His journey into the blockchain space goes back six years ago. The first time he heard about blockchain was when he was still working in the banking area. It took him two years to understand the goal of the technology behind Bitcoin and the impact it will have on his profession and on the whole society. He learned a lot and after two years he decided to leave the banking sector, in 2014, and setup his own business, linked to the financial sector. The non-financial inclusion issue determined him to work on a solution that will end this problem.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>“I started to work on a solution to enable and bring more people to have access to financial services, because there are up to 3 billion people who don’t have access to affordable financial services.”</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>When he decided to start the Flash Group ecosystem, he tried to find any other solution similar to the one he was willing to put forward and he couldn’t find any.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>“The most important here on the distributed ledger technology it’s that this sector reminds me a little bit of the dot com period. We don’t know yet where all of these will lead us.”</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>“When I benchmarked my solution, I found out that there was no alternative to what I was willing to do, so we decided to go for a seed round three years ago. We raised more than $72 Million and we took out time to develop out ecosystem. We decided to go for a mix of hardware and software.”</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Serge believes that if people don’t have means to payment services and to cash out it’s a very complicated issue. There are more than 7,000 cryptocurrencies on the market now and many more will come. Hence, for a newcomer into the industry, it’s complicated to understand the technology.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>“What matters for the client is the service, not the technology, and whether the service will be easy to access. Basically, what I think is that in order for the crypto market to grow, first of all we need interoperability. If you want to go mainstream, we also need utility coins; something that you will be able to use on a daily basis to do remittance or to buy any random services.”</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Serge stresses the importance of utility coins. Hence, people should be able to use a utility coin on a daily basis, without the risk of a lower exchange rate.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>“You need a coin which is relatively stable. The coin that we are proposing, the OZTG, it’s gold pegged, meaning that the core value of the coin is coming from an asset that everybody understands. We are trying to create an intrinsic value of the coin, but at the same time, to attract both sides of the blockchain industry, meaning those willing to speculate, and those willing to have a relatively stable coin.”</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The <a href=\\\"https://www.ozeety.com/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">OZTG coin</a> is the cornerstone of <a href=\\\"https://flashgroup.io/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">Flash Group</a> and <a href=\\\"https://sapiangroup.com/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">Sapian Group</a> products. It allows the use of the entire ecosystem with products like the cryptostations, the <a href=\\\"https://www.oztcard.com/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">OZT smart card</a> and the smart wallet. The OZT blockchain uses Proof-of-Stake protocol, which was first introduced in the blockchain space by Dash. There are not many companies using this protocol.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>“First of all, it’s good for the planet, because you are saving energy and you can have more transactions and when you are trying to go mainstream, you need more power. Also, our coin is linked to a tangible asset and that brings more value to the coin. We will be audited once a quarter to ensure the community that we have enough gold to continue pegging the coin that we are proposing to the network.”</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Serge points out that in a market with very few coins that are asset pegged or asset backed, people need stability. Every month, in the blockchain space, we see new terms emerging. For example, <a href=\\\"https://flashgroupnews.com/2020/10/19/internet-blockchain-icos-defi-dao-what-next/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">DeFi</a> (decentralised finance) is one of the new terms and it represents a new financial system.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>“For me, <a href=\\\"https://flashgroupnews.com/2020/10/14/what-is-the-future-centralised-finance-cefi-or-decentralised-finance-defi/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">DeFi</a> is the closest thing that can disrupt the traditional finance.”</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Serge doesn’t venture in predictions about the future, but he has a well determined plan for the Flash Group and Sapian Group ecosystem.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>“I can’t predict the future, but I can say that we have been watching the market and what the mainstream population will need. What we found out it’s that we were on the right path from the beginning. We want to propose to the people 360 solutions, both hardware and software. We will win the battle when we will integrate a lot more the merchant into the battle, because today there are not many strategies focusing on the merchant.”</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Serge emphasises the importance of making life easy for merchants in terms of cashing out. This way, more merchants will adopt crypto solutions and people will have more places to spend their coins.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>“For the public, the coin will be listed on the FlashXchanger, which is a parent company of the group. We have decided to put most of the liquidity into our own exchange and to partner with two or three other exchanges outside the organisation.”</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Flash Group and Sapian Group have adopted a strategy of not listing the coin on too many exchanges in order to maintain its stability and liquidity.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>For more information about Flash Group and Sapian Group, people can access the website flashgroup.io, look for Flash Group on Twitter or check the blog at blog.flashmoni.io.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>For the full interview click <a rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\" href=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NgSJ2VpkG5U\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">here</a>, or on the video below.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\\\"wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\\\"><div class=\\\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\\\">\\n<iframe title=\\\"Serge Lobreau interview with Flash Group News\\\" width=\\\"696\\\" height=\\\"392\\\" src=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/NgSJ2VpkG5U?feature=oembed&#038;enablejsapi=1\\\" frameborder=\\\"0\\\" allow=\\\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\\\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\\n</div></figure>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Author: Georgiana Dogaru</p>\\n\",\"protected\":false},\"excerpt\":{\"rendered\":\"<p>The Covid19 lockdown looked like really bad news for Serge Lobreau, who previously travelled to more than 55 countries all over the world to attend events and meet business people, but at the end of the day, it was a blessing in disguise.

DeFi tokens, especially the loans and <a href=\\\"https://flashgroupnews.com/2020/09/18/oztg-coin-and-ozeety-blockchain-proof-of-stake-with-yield-farming-is-bigger-than-defi/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">yield farming</a> trend, have disrupted the financial system with unexpectedly huge profits. On the other hand, centralised finance (CeFi) is close to traditional finance and it’s a choice for more traditional investors, not for the high risk takers. But for both risk takers and traditional investors, diversification could be the key that ensures they are not missing good opportunities.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>What we should know about Centralised Finance (CeFi)</strong></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Even though <a href=\\\"https://flashgroupnews.com/2020/10/05/exploring-decentralized-finances-issues-tools-and-solutions/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">DeFi</a> is very popular, is not the only alternative to traditional finance. CeFi, or Centralised Finance, is another branch of blockchain-based finance that is disrupting the traditional banking industry. Both DeFi and CeFi are related to digital asset management, offer the possibility of much higher yields and aim to create better financial inclusivity.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The traditional financial system runs on centralised infrastructure managed by central authorities, institutions, and intermediaries. An advantage of CeFi services is that they provide holistic solutions, that are regulated by large and they can adapt faster to the needs of customers. For example, on a CeFi exchange all orders are controlled by one&nbsp;central&nbsp;exchange with no other competing parties. The main aim of CeFi is to make fair trades, boost more transactions, and increase buying and selling processes in a controlled accountable manner.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>“Our views, echoed by several other exchange and digital banking leaders, including CZ of Binance, is that CeFi and CEX versus DEX is still in the early days, largely because even in a decentralised platform there are some people who actually are responsible in controlling that platform,” said Mru Patel, CEO of <a href=\\\"https://sapiangroup.com/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">Sapian Group</a> and COO of <a href=\\\"https://flashgroup.io/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">Flash Group</a>. “What happens when investors lose their holdings? Who is accountable? Who holds the actual coins? Who is custodian of investor assets? These questions of trust and accountability are key factors that need to be addressed in any decentralised platform. Many exchanges and digital banks have been hacked and in a centralised platform at least the owners are responsible to credit back the investor’s assets, whilst in a decentralised platform that is still unchartered territory which needs to be developed. In the case of the FlashXchanger, we allow the investor the choice of holding their assets in their own wallets or vaults, or even their own secured cloud platforms of choice. Hence, they are responsible for their holding against hacks,” continued Mru Patel.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>What we should know about Decentralised Finance (DeFi)</strong></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Decentralised Finance <a href=\\\"https://flashgroupnews.com/2020/10/07/asset-backed-defi-gold/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">(DeFi</a>) is a decentralised ecosystem of blockchain-based financial instruments that use smart contracts and are designed outside of companies’ and governments’ regulation. Decentralised finance runs on the decentralised infrastructure of the Ethereum blockchain by deploying immutable smart contracts. A smart contract allows users to trade, invest, and send tokens without any third-party involved, as a self-executing programmable contract between the user and the platform.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Centralised authorities are not involved at all in the process and the main idea is to create financial services that are opened to everybody through a permisionless ecosystem. Also, the platform doesn’t store the private keys of the user’s funds. The keys are managed only by the user, which gives it more security.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>DeFi recreates traditional financial services like trading, lending, borrowing or insurance. Decentralised applications (dApps) rely on smart contracts, with no intermediaries needed to process transactions and no middleman that has control over customer’s assets.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>CeFi vs. DeFi</strong></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>DeFi and CeFi represent an innovative, disruptive paradigm in the financial sector. They both have different benefits that help investors get better returns, but there are also some aspects that differentiate them.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In terms of private key management, DeFi has a non-custodial approach, while CeFi looks more like the traditional finance. In CeFi, centralised corporations bear custody, so they are responsible for safekeeping their users’ funds and information.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In governance, the CeFi, corporate management is responsible for making decisions for current and future state of the companies. Many centralised exchanges get involved and reward users for storing assets in interest-yielding savings accounts. On the other hand, in DeFi, the communities, such as the platform governance token holders, are responsible for managing the platforms.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>When it comes to interest rates determination, CeFi and DeFi are different. CeFi platforms entirely hold the power to define the interest rate. DeFi platforms use market data and proprietary data provided by market participants. Based on that, they let governance token holders vote on whether an adjustment of the interest rate needs to be done or not.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Centralised exchanges (CEX) can be seen as a vulnerability in the decentralised blockchain ecosystem. They are an easy target of hacks, fraud, and manipulation. Even though they can’t assure high security for their customers, they charge huge listing fees for new projects, creating this way barriers to entry for small projects. On a decentralised exchange (DEX), any project can be listed for free, regardless of size. However, the downside to this openness is that decentralised exchanges become an easy target for scams, hacks, and exploitation of smart contracts and users. It’s a free play for the bad actors that often list tokens and offer services with little to no business fundamentals and zero concept of any regulations, rules or principles. It’s left entirely onto the investors to do their own due diligence, with very little information available, apart from hype and paid media, air droppers, and early investors FOMO (who often dump the day or so after the listing bring the price down by an average of 60% +). DeFi in principle is great, as long as people are transparent, share values for business sustainability and fully disclose the teams responsible and their experiences.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>DeFi use cases</strong></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In terms of use cases, DeFi offers a complex ecosystem of instruments created to earn money:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul><li>Trading and Liquidity Providers</li><li>Lending and Borrowing</li><li>Stablecoins</li><li>DAOs</li><li>Asset Management, Staking, and Yield Farming</li><li>Derivatives and Synthetic Assets</li><li>Insurance</li><li>Decentralised Exchanges (DEXs)</li><li>Margin trading</li><li>Prediction Markets</li><li>Tokenization</li></ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The vast majority of such services are already established and tested in CeFi models for years.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>What are the trends</strong></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Currently, some of the most important elements of a platform are: business fundamentals, business sustainability, simplified user experience, transparency, security, cost efficiency and education, to name but a few. These can help grow the number of users. Also, the complexity of the DeFi platforms is an important aspect. As investors are looking for higher yields, the platforms need to design instruments that deliver growing returns.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Considering that both CeFi and DeFi have their own purpose, in the future there must be a careful balance between centralised and decentralised exchanges. Also, we see a middle group hybrid developing before a full trusted platform for DeFi is established. One thing is for sure, all these decentralised technologies attempt to do is cut the middlemen and that’s good to deliver better returns and services to the client.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Whether DeFi and CeFi will endure the test of time and overtake traditional finance is yet to be seen, but one thing is sure: &nbsp;the rapid development of alternative finance is a long-term trend.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>Some food for thought on the market size:</strong></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Total daily trading volume – $7 T per day</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Total market cap for all equities – $80 T</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Daily foreign exchange market – $5 T per day</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Total trading on derivatives – estimated $640 T</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Crypto derivatives total trading – $2 T (Q1 2020); $62.5 T (the highest daily trading volume)</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Total crypto market cap – $350 B</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Daily trading volume – $75B per day</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>NOTE from all of the above, one thing is for sure that there is huge potential for Digital CeFi, CEX, DEX and DeFi, as the market size is enough to sustain thousands of players before any consolidation occurs.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>We are working on a detailed research on all crypto and DeFi tokens (trading volume, market cap, categories of service, gains and losses, etc.) Please register on this site to see this report.</p>\\n\",\"protected\":false},\"excerpt\":{\"rendered\":\"<p>In the past few months, decentralised finance (DeFi) had a meteoric rise and it keeps going up.

Governments and traditional financial institutions feel threatened by the disruption created by revolutionary technologies. Currently, there are minimal regulations in the crypto space and most political institutions have not shown where they stand when it comes to blockchain and its use cases, let alone cryptocurrency. The future could bring a clearer position from governments, which could create laws to support a safe and secure use of cryptocurrencies, but it can also go on the opposite side. A lot of the governments have started to accept the digital currency movement by creating their own version of currency under the central banking digital currency (CBDC). UK, China, India, Germany, France are some examples of such countries.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>Bitcoin – a love and hate relationship with governments</strong></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>While the majority of countries haven’t made the usage of Bitcoin itself illegal yet, its status as money or commodity varies. Some countries have allowed the use and trade of BTC, while others have specifically banned or restricted any use of BTC. Currently, there are already some countries that have banned any form of owning or using any type of cryptocurrencies. Countries like Egypt, Nepal, Ecuador, Algeria or Pakistan have decided that cryptocurrencies are a threat for economy and not a friend.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Bitcoin relies 100% on cryptography, not on a central entity that runs under KYC regulations. As it is decentralised, the network cannot be shut down by any government. However, governments could jointly decide to ban Bitcoin if they think it is used for illegal purposes. This could only occur if the bitcoin price dramatically reaches to obscene levels like over $500K or $1 million.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>Bitcoin – a potential outlaw</strong></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Should Bitcoin reach $1 million in valuation, it will become an outlaw in the eyes of governments. The possibility of huge amounts of money laundering happening within seconds could determine political authorities to take extreme measures against BTC. The ban could go even further than Bitcoin and target all cryptocurrencies, which have volatile prices that can increase tens or even hundreds of times within days in the case of the new DeFi and NFT based tokens. This creates a spotlight from the authorities.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Bitcoin can become a transaction vehicle, especially if there will be regulations to create the framework for that, but if it reaches a high price like $1 million, it could also become a vehicle for fast and easy money laundering. We all know that money laundering is no new concept and it hasn’t started with cryptocurrencies, in fact there is more being done in FIAT especially in USD than any other currency. The estimated amount of money laundered globally is 2 – 5% in one year of the global GDP, which is $800 billion – $2 trillion. Even so, if one BTC could clean $1M dirty money, the worries are not groundless. Cash notes are not trackable either, but most probably political entities will not allow another way, even easier, of washing money. Imagine anonymous transactions within millions or even billions. The risk of that happening would trigger an immediate reaction form authorities that would use their power to prevent such things.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>Bitcoin – the new gold?</strong></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In a brighter scenario, BTC could become a digital store of value in the same category as gold. Just like in the 1930’s, when gold was becoming popular as a store of value and US governments specifically tried to stop the movement and fix the price. The constant move continued through various recessions or calamities, like the 9/11, whereby majority of investors sought to find some form of security to hold gold post a recession, due to various governments FIAT currency inflation and deflation related moves.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>It was just a short time of maturity in the digital currency space, pioneered by the Bitcoin decentralised acceptance by the people. Once again, banks and governments tried for the past years to criticise it and make it extremely difficult to trade in it. Just like the struggle gold had before its acceptance, when the USA held 75% of the gold reserves at the time, Bitcoin is slowly becoming the same store of value which is easier as it’s held in a digital manner and decentralised in terms of governance. No central control or point of failure reported to date.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>People have lost their currency largely due to exchange or vault hacks just like gold robberies in the physical world. Hence, as the popularity of digital currencies increases, digital versions of fiat currencies will be considered more and more by governments. The movement is now established as a means for financial transactions, as well as a store of value is concerned in the case of Bitcoin.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>Bitcoin and the bright side of crypto</strong></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Bitcoin could be banned, but it could also be regulated, depending on its future performance and how governments would weigh its benefits vs. threats for the global economy. Just like how gold was banned in 1933 under private ownership by Franklin Roosevelt, it could happen to Bitcoin too. However, the Bitcoin community has grown exponentially since 2009, when BTC was created, and its popularity has not gone down. The fact that it hasn’t been banned so far could prove that governments have given innovation a chance and they are waiting to see how it evolves. If they thought BTC was a threat, they would have already banned it, but BTC is still here. Countries tried to ban trading in crypto for long too, but that actually encouraged people to buy more. The only issue being should the BTC price rise to really crazy levels, that possibility still lingers on, as we are in unchartered territory.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Nobody knows what the future will bring, but the fate of Bitcoin would be very interesting to watch. There are predictions showing that three to five biggest nations globally will completely replace their national currencies with a central bank digital currency (CBDC) by 2030. Various countries are in different stages of creating a CBDC, such as China, UK, Germany, France, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, France, Sweden, Turkey, Bahamas and others.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Technology has proven its usefulness during the Covid-19 pandemic and it will most likely not stop here in its innovation. Bitcoin could become the new digital gold or it could only be a memory in a few years. Governments have the authority to regulate it or ban it, so before giving power to the people, the power to change the society is still in the hands of the political actors. Like in the case of gold, when the USA owned 75% of supply in reserve, if they could own that amount of Bitcoin, it would be a different story. However, the corporates, hedge funds and UHNWIs will only buy more and increase their holding and their values, until such time when the politicians enter the digital age fully and see the benefits, rather than job losses.</p>\\n\",\"protected\":false},\"excerpt\":{\"rendered\":\"<p>Author: Mru Patel, Partner and CEO of&nbsp;Sapian Group, Partner and COO of&nbsp;Flash Group Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies have brought power to the people, but not everybody is happy about that.

He has covered more miles than Santa Claus on an average Christmas Eve night.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>When the world went into lockdown, Mru turned his not inconsiderable energy into a <a href=\\\"https://flashgroupnews.com/2020/10/05/exploring-decentralized-finances-issues-tools-and-solutions/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">DeFi</a> project with a difference; one that was asset-backed by gold that he was involved in 2 years prior. The gold asset in question had been bought two years ago and used to peg the <a href=\\\"https://www.ozeety.com\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">OZTG coin</a>. The coin, so pegged, has more than doubled in value.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>With a rising gold price continuing during the pandemic, Mru assures me that even if the flight to quality falls off, the OZTG coin will never fall below $0.13.&nbsp; The main reason is the intrinsic value of the gold at the time of the peg with a conservative price that was set in the blockchain not to fall below $0.13. This does not account for the true market price of Gold versus the OZTG coin as 1/20<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;gram the price of gold.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>It is not surprising that Mru and his partner <a href=\\\"https://lobreauserge.com/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">Serge Lobreau</a> have come up with another innovative product, indeed a suite of products, because he is not a man to sit still, even when in lockdown. A serial entrepreneur, he has worked in fintech and property investment related businesses before the terms were created. His entire career began with Plessey /GEC, Sony and Motorola and their smartphones, dabbling in VoIP. He also worked with leading bluechip companies the likes of Siemens, Nixdorf, Unisys, IBM and Sun Microsystems during the prime days of dot-com and Java.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>“Innovation doesn’t come every day; it comes in waves like the dot.com boom. Blockchain has existed a long time – it’s just a lot of transactions on blocks made secure by cryptology. In fact, when I was first told about bitcoin, I said it’ll never catch on, governments won’t allow it – they still hate it.”</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>It took a crazy night clubbing about nine years ago to change his mind. He met someone who said it was cheaper to buy bitcoin than all the champagne he had bought.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>“But it was the disruptive nature of the technology that caught my interest. During the 2008 crash I had lost millions of dollars in my real estate investment fund. Post crisis, I wanted to find a way of rebuilding my business, using my talents but also to disrupt what I saw was an inherently corrupt banking system. I originally wanted to do proptech but it was too soon and I saw fintech as the way to go.”</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Mru was very present during the chaotic years of the ICO, speaking at several conferences around the world, and he used what he learnt there to build a better model in time for the true digital banking and DeFi bubble.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>“The biggest issue with the crowdfunding championed by the ICOs is that they were managed by smart tech people with little business acumen, and even less idea on how to manage investment and investors.”</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>“Another aspect was the anonymity of the team. If I am going to invest a million dollars in a project, I want to see the team and understand the businesses they have run before. Another issue was to see what they had developed already. I was not in favour of investing in an idea where no coding or product development had even started. That’s a good way to lose your shirt.”</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Which led Mru to assemble principles for building in this space: have the project asset backed, run by an experienced team and let the platform be built already – not just an idea.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>“Many of the projects in DeFi are totally anonymous and are not original – having copied another project’s open source code and then used a humorous food-based name. That’s just lazy and is primed to pump and dump.”</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Mru points to some basic business investing tenets.&nbsp; Is there a real USP? Will they survive, Is there liquidity in the project. Do they have an office?</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>“A lot of these early DeFi projects are copy-cat, no-hopers, but this is just the first wave – they will mature.”</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Backing the OZEETY blockchain and ecosystem project with gold has led people to ask to see video of the gold but Mru reckons that means nothing. The company plans on getting one of the big six to provide an audit of the gold held in a vault in Dubai.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>“My partner owned several gold mines so it was acquired at a lower than market price. With the increase in the price of gold, that has almost doubled and we now have more than $100 million worth of gold.”</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Mru and Flash Group are in growth mode. The company has plans for cryptostations, where people can find Crypto ATMs. The first concept store facility will open in Luxembourg. Payments and Crypto purchases can be done by a card which bypasses the banking system. The card is biometric and holds four gigabytes of cold storage, allowing people to hold their different crypto in one place. His team is also building out a smart wallet, and an omnichannel exchange. The latter is due to go live within a month; they are currently going through security audits.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>“We have a financial Institution, wallet and exchange license in Europe for all our products – something I wager none of the existing <a href=\\\"https://flashgroupnews.com/2020/09/18/oztg-coin-and-ozeety-blockchain-proof-of-stake-with-yield-farming-is-bigger-than-defi/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">DeFi</a> products can claim.”</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The company’s vision is to offer paid banking to the clients. “We want to pay people to bank with us. Say you stake 10,000 coins with us, for a specified period, you get a return that is calculated daily and which you can see increasing in your wallet on a compounded basis.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The company is also building in affiliate sales and marketing to quickly build a community. “People can choose a package that suits them and earn passive income.&nbsp; It starts as little as €126 to invest and you are put into a pool with other investors. It will deliver between 250% and 300% per annum, which is shared across the investors in the pool. The Masternode programme has a higher entry level and greater returns – but again the project does not spend the investment on fancy offices and large corporate salaries – the returns are shared on the platform.”</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The income is created through the OZEETY blockchain platform taking a very small fee off transactions but relying on the volume of transactions to deliver the income. For this to work, the company is adding many layers onto the platform; the exchange, health products, and validation operations and about 8 more features which are currently in train.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>October sees a mobile offering where people can also earn money. Again, Mru stresses it is with the same OZTG asset pegged. To find out more, just ping Mru a message or join one of the community’s active platforms. “Come and have a look, do your due diligence. So far we have in excess of 300 people involved in the Masternode and Pool nodes passive income program and it’s growing all the time.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>“We’re building a proper digital banking organisation that gives you money for banking with us – only it’s new age banking with much more features and fairness. The mission and goal of the company is to truly deliver “Financial Vision and Beyond”.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>For further information visit:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><a href=\\\"https://www.flashgroup.io\\\">https://www.flashgroup.io</a></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><a href=\\\"https://ozeety.com\\\">https://ozeety.com</a></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><a href=\\\"https://oztcard.com\\\">https://oztcard.com</a></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><a href=\\\"https://Ollorun.com\\\">https://Ollorun.com</a></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><a href=\\\"https://flashxchanger.com\\\">https://flashxchanger.com</a></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Discord groups: FlashXchanger, Ollorun Network (the sales arm of the network marketing community)</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Telegram group –&nbsp;<a rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\" href=\\\"https://t.me/FLASHMONI_ANNOUNCEMENTS\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">https://t.me/FLASHMONI_ANNOUNCEMENTS</a></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>For watching the whole video, click on the link below</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\\\"wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\\\"><div class=\\\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\\\">\\n<iframe title=\\\"Podcast 52: Mru Patel, CEO of Sapian Group and COO of Flash Group\\\" width=\\\"696\\\" height=\\\"392\\\" src=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/WR2Lgi396As?feature=oembed&#038;enablejsapi=1\\\" frameborder=\\\"0\\\" allow=\\\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\\\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\\n</div></figure>\\n\",\"protected\":false},\"excerpt\":{\"rendered\":\"<p>Before COVID19, Mru Parel, CEO Sapian Group and COO of Flash Group, was one of the best-known speakers on the international Blockchain circuit, travelling to 30plus conferences in more than 15 countries over an 8 month period and catching more than 100 flights.

Another advantage of a Blockchain serving as a means of payment is that the payments passing through it are irreversible, which can be very attractive for merchants affected by credit card fraud.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>When it comes to transaction fees, receiving payment in cryptocurrencies has no fees. However, almost all merchants accepting this type of payment prefer to go through a payment provider who will automatically and instantly convert between Bitcoin and local currency. The most important of them in terms of customers, Bitpay, charges 1% &#8211; 2% per transaction, a figure to compare with Paypal, which charges 3.4%, and with the cost to accept bank cards, which can often exceed 1.5% &#8211; 3% for internet transactions. Similarly, a payment between currencies is less expensive than a conventional bank transfer.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Payments in cryptocurrency are validated in a short time. In most cases, one hour is enough for the transaction to be confirmed and irreversible. The money is therefore available on the merchant&#8217;s account very quickly. In contrast, although instant on the client-side, bank card payments take several days to reach the merchant&#8217;s bank account. This lag leads to a cost of cash for businesses that could be reduced by the Blockchain. Also, for the merchant, there are 180 days during which the transaction can be unilaterally cancelled by the card issuer (at the request of the end customer, in the event of fraud or litigation). Therefore, the time for a transaction to be final is one hour for payment in cryptocurrency and 180 days for payment by bank card.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In the same way, for individuals and small and medium-sized businesses, an international transfer can take over 7 working days to reach their destination. During this period, on the one hand, the funds are immobilized because they are not available either for the sender or the recipient of the transfer and on the other hand, there is a significant exchange rate risk. Blockchain could, therefore, make the payments sector more efficient.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Blockchain, and more precisely, the different cryptocurrencies resulting from it, can revolutionize access to a payment method for countries and populations where accounts and bank cards are little or no widespread. We are thinking in particular of African countries with a low bank enrolment rate.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>A bank account is not required to use cryptocurrencies as a means of payment; having a smartphone is enough. African countries have excellent network coverage for mobile phones and a high rate of telephones per capita. Therefore, the prospects for Africa are considerable and could allow access to financial and payment services to the highest number, especially in remote regions. This is of interest to mobile operators and, particularly, Orange, which is very present on the African market, which recently bought Groupama in France to gain experience in the banking sector and invested in the startup Chain.com, a specialist in Blockchain. Therefore, the idea of ​​Orange is to combine these three areas to adapt to the specific needs of its customers, especially Africans.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Author: Mru Patel, Partner and COO of <a href=\\\"https://flashgroup.io/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">Flash Group</a>, CEO of <a href=\\\"https://sapiangroup.com/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">Sapian Group</a></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Extract from the upcoming book <em><strong>A Guide to Blockchain and Crypto Investments</strong></em></p>\\n\",\"protected\":false},\"excerpt\":{\"rendered\":\"<p>Payment methods Blockchain can disrupt the payments industry by allowing significant improvements in 4 areas: security, transaction costs, transaction times, and access to a means of payment for the highest number.

The economy in such countries is struggling to recover. These consist of several African countries, war stricken countries like Syria, Iran, Iraq, Afghanistan, Lebanon, various South American countries like Venezuela and Paraguay, to name but a few.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>The rule of banks – a painful lesson</strong><strong></strong></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Let’s look at Lebanon as one of the latest economically hit for the moment. It is classified as a developing, upper-middle income economy, with a nominal GDP estimated at $54.1 billion in 2018 and a per capita GDP amounting to $12,000. The Lebanese financial system is dominated by banks. Lebanon’s banks have been seen as the most important part of the country’s economy for decades. From 2011 to 2019 their combined assets had increased 83%, reaching a staggering $253B. That equals almost five times the country’s economic output.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>But from a lavish life in big glass buildings, now bankers are hiding in branches barricaded with thick metal plates to protect them from protesters and firebombs. Since March, a crisis has accelerated in Lebanon that affects the economic, fiscal and monetary sectors, with a government debt of $90B. Lebanon’s exports are very little and imports are high, while its economy is burdened by one of the world’s largest debts. Inflation increased to 56.5 % in May, and in June protesters started fires outside the central bank’s office in Tripoli. On the walls in Beirut, it’s written “down with the rule of bank”.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\\\"wp-block-image size-large\\\"><a href=\\\"https://flashgroup.io/\\\"><img loading=\\\"lazy\\\" width=\\\"1024\\\" height=\\\"1024\\\" src=\\\"https://flashgroupnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/WhatsApp-Image-2020-09-22-at-22.44.05.jpeg\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"wp-image-2786\\\" srcset=\\\"https://flashgroupnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/WhatsApp-Image-2020-09-22-at-22.44.05.jpeg 1024w, https://flashgroupnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/WhatsApp-Image-2020-09-22-at-22.44.05-640x640.jpeg 640w, https://flashgroupnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/WhatsApp-Image-2020-09-22-at-22.44.05-160x160.jpeg 160w, https://flashgroupnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/WhatsApp-Image-2020-09-22-at-22.44.05-120x120.jpeg 120w, https://flashgroupnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/WhatsApp-Image-2020-09-22-at-22.44.05-360x360.jpeg 360w, https://flashgroupnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/WhatsApp-Image-2020-09-22-at-22.44.05-80x80.jpeg 80w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\\\" /></a><figcaption>www.flashgroup.io</figcaption></figure>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>Lebanon’s burdened economy</strong><strong></strong></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>“With very few sources of foreign exchange, Lebanon depends almost entirely on its diaspora to send cash to the banking system, which is then converted to finance imports and the state deficit. This now is hindered by all the current deflationary exchange rates that are offered for any local currency conversion,” highlights <a rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\" href=\\\"https://lobreauserge.com\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">Serge Maurice Lobreau</a>, Chairman and Founder of <a href=\\\"https://sapiangroup.com/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">Sapian Group</a> and <a rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\" href=\\\"https://flashgroup.io/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">Flash Group</a>.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>For several years in a row, the economic growth has been between 1-2%, but in 2019 has fallen to zero. Despite the economic problems, the government continued to borrow. The economic chaos is a result of years of corruption, inefficiency and waste. People blame bankers and politicians for the increasing poverty and unemployment rate. The system has been mainly against people and pro banks, helping banks generate huge profits, until the system broke down. The total losses estimated across the banking sector are at $69B, with the central bank alone having $50B in losses.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Lenders have set limits on withdrawals and those who owned dollars bank account cannot exchange it on the international rates (up to 50% devaluation). This way, people are forced to pay everything in local currency. Also, no one can send money outside the country. The scarcity of dollars led to a weak Lebanese pound which made the exchange prices go up. Even the state owned mobile operators are expensive.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>Corruption and riots</strong><strong></strong></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Hence, the Lebanese people have started to call the dollar they have “Lollar”. A Lollar is a US dollar that is stuck in the Lebanese banking system. It is just a computer entry with no corresponding currency. The term was coined by Harvard economic fellow Dan Azzi, an Advanced Leadership fellow at Harvard University,&nbsp;after the severe economic crisis in Lebanon.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The protesters have accused the political elite of exploiting the state resources for their own benefits and for the people in their inner circles.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Lebanon is not a typical Arab country. Unlike other Arab states, Lebanon doesn’t have one ruler, but many leaders and political parties, and there are people saying that the system has kept the ruling cast in power for decades and allowed politicians to put their own interest above those of the people and the state. Because of corruption and lack of reform, the political system brought the economy into a desperate situation that made people riot out in the streets and ask for serious changes in their country.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The current issue is highlighted by a recent conversation with a local friend who wishes to be anonymous. He recently tried to exchange his locally stored Dollars in the bank to convert to cash and was offered 50% of the value. Furthermore, due to the large sum involved, his bank account got blocked, so he cannot even have access to his own hard earned cash savings until next year. There are several people in such situations. The people outside the country seriously need to consider alternative banking solutions. The Fintech and <a href=\\\"http://FlashGroup.io\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">DeFi</a> space is disrupting the traditional banking space specifically for such reasons, where central governments and banks control where, how and how much you get for your cash. A sad situation we have seen in many parts of the world. It is for this reason why the Fintech and <a href=\\\"http://FlashGroup.io\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">DeFi</a> market is taking off.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\\\"wp-block-image size-large\\\"><img loading=\\\"lazy\\\" width=\\\"1280\\\" height=\\\"853\\\" src=\\\"https://flashgroupnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/oztcard_newsletter-1280x853.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"wp-image-2779\\\" srcset=\\\"https://flashgroupnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/oztcard_newsletter-1280x853.jpg 1280w, https://flashgroupnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/oztcard_newsletter-640x427.jpg 640w, https://flashgroupnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/oztcard_newsletter-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://flashgroupnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/oztcard_newsletter-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://flashgroupnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/oztcard_newsletter.jpg 2048w, https://flashgroupnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/oztcard_newsletter-360x240.jpg 360w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px\\\" /><figcaption>https://flashgroup.io/</figcaption></figure>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>Technology is the answer</strong><strong></strong></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>With the advent of the Blockchain and digital currencies taking the world by storm, one solution the citizens can deploy is to adopt a full digital currency ecosystem. The diaspora has several solutions at hand that are significantly better than all major traditional banks. “Imagine getting a better interest on your funds, full access globally at interbanking rates, spend at will from your digital wallet, exchange the funds to any Fiat or digital currency, have an associated debit card that you can spend at merchants and so on. The <a rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\" href=\\\"https://flashgroup.io/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">Flash Group</a>’s solution offers such flexibility and keeps you in control of your finances,” explained Mru Patel, partner and CEO of <a href=\\\"https://sapiangroup.com/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">Sapian Group</a> Ltd and COO of <a rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\" href=\\\"https://flashgroup.io/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">Flash Group</a> Ltd. “The <a rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\" href=\\\"https://www.flashxchanger.com/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">FlashXchanger</a>, FlashWallet (fully licensed financial institution, digital exchange and wallet), virtual and biometric digital card, cryptostations for depositing cash to buy crypto are the solutions that help transition to a decentralized financial system.

The suit is brought to the United States District Court of the Southern District of Florida by the estate of David Kleiman.</p>\\n<p>David Kleiman was a computer scientist and cyber-security expert, whom many suspect to have been one of the developers behind Bitcoin and the Blockchain technology.</p>\\n<p>In documents which surfaced on Reddit, the plaintiff claims that Wright stole hundreds of thousands of BTC, worth over $5 bln dollars at today’s rate, from David Kleiman’s estate. The statement by the plaintiff alleges that Wright recognized that Kleiman’s friends and family were initially unaware of the wealth he accumulated.</p>\\n<p>The official complaint states that Wright took advantage of this and “forged a series of contracts that purported to transfer Dave’s assets to Craig and/or companies controlled by him. Craig backdated these contracts and forged Dave’s signature on them.”</p>\\n<p>The plaintiff continues in the document, stating that following David Kleiman’s death on April 26, 2013, Wright contacted Kleiman’s estate and disclosed that he and David had worked together to develop Blockchain and Bitcoin.</p>\\n<p>According to the estate, Wright claimed that David had signed away any rights to resulting wealth or intellectual property in exchange for a non-controlling and non-operational share in an Australian company. According to the plaintiff, Wright estimated the share to be worth “millions”., and informed the Kleiman estate that he’d be able to sell the share on the estate’s behalf within a few months.</p>\\n<p>Apparently this was a lie, as the company went bankrupt after Wright misled the Australian Taxation Office (ATO). In late 2015, Australian police raided Wright’s home, and Wright fled to the UK from Australia.</p>\\n<p>To date, the plaintiff states that Wright hasn’t returned any of the bitcoins or the intellectual property rights to the Kleiman estate. The lawsuit is “brought to rectify that injustice.”</p>\\n<p>Kleiman is seeking compensation for the intellectual property in addition to the 5 bln BTC fortune.</p>\\n<p>While Wright no longer claims he is Satoshi Nakamoto, and the lawsuit does not seek to discover or define the identity of that individual, the proceedings may require that identity to be established in order to find a definite ruling.</p>\\n<p>Wright has issued a one-word statement regarding the lawsuit via Twitter</p>\\n\",\"protected\":false},\"excerpt\":{\"rendered\":\"<p>Chief scientist of nChain and self-proclaimed mind behind the Satoshi Nakamoto pseudonym, Craig Wright, is being sued for $5 bln.

It also is cold storage, a feature that ensures safety of fiat and crypto currencies&#8217; wallets     Remittance services (FlashRemitt) allowing instant transfer of crypto/fiat currencies     Exchange platform (FlashXchanger) for cryptocurrencies and 180 fiat currencies\\n</ul>\\n<p>In addition to Flashmoni&#8217;s tools, the company offers two gold-backed tokens at the center of its financial ecosystem:</p>\\n<p>    OZG is a private, non-tradable token directly backed by physical 24k gold that will be stored in a depository and audited quarterly by an independent and internationally known audit firm. This is a security coin that will not be available to the public, but ensures the system&#8217;s stability.<br />\\n    OZTG is a tradable utility token backed by OZG, meaning its core value is also backed by gold. It is available to the public and will be found on exchanges including <a href=\\\"https://www.flashxchanger.com/\\\" rel=\\\"noopener noreferrer\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">FlashXchanger</a>.\\n</ul>\\n<p>OZG&#8217;s value is equivalent to 1 grain of gold, or about 0.065 grams, and will not fluctuate with market movements, as it is not available on public exchanges. OZTG&#8217;s price will fluctuate based on trading, however, its price will never fall below 1/20 of OZG&#8217;s value. Unlike the majority of tokens on the market, OZT has a core value because it is backed by the amount of gold the company has stored.</p>\\n<p>During Phase 1 of Flashmoni&#8217;s crowdsale, the company raised $62 million U.S. Dollars. There are still approximately 141 million OZT tokens remaining, with a hard cap of $100 million.</p>\\n<p>Flashmoni will be able to keep rates and fees low by focusing on its advertising solution as its primary generator of revenue. Its blockchain advertising solution (FlashAdChain) boasts smart contracts and ensures fully transparent advertising rates.</p>\\n<p>Flashmoni is based in Lisbon with offices in London, Singapore and Dubai. Prior to launching its ICO, the Flashmoni&#8217;s leadership team bootstrapped the initial development of the company and its solutions, unique in the ICO-space. The ICO is closed to general investors in the U.S.</p>\\n<p>About Flashmoni<br />\\nFlashmoni is a blockchain company built for financial inclusion. As part of its comprehensive financial ecosystem, it provides banking solutions to everyone in the global community – most importantly the unbanked and underbanked. Flashmoni&#8217;s ecosystem can be divided into three essential components: Cryptocurrency tokens, tools for the unbanked/underbanked and advertising solutions. Specifically, it offers a utility gold-backed token and its tools include physical crypto ATMs, multi-currencies digital wallets, a fiat and cryptocurrency exchange platform, a smart-card used for payments and remittance services. Additionally, Flashmoni has created an advertising solution featuring smart contracts, which serves as its primary source of revenue and allows it to keep fees and costs at a minimum.</p>\\n<p>For the original version on PRWeb visit: http://www.prweb.com/releases/2018/04/prweb15399228.htm</p>\\n\",\"protected\":false},\"excerpt\":{\"rendered\":\"<p>Flashmoni&#8217;s financial ecosystem set to include several services for unbanked and underbanked, Company raised $62 million USD in phase one.

Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) have also become the centre of attention in the last few months. According to the technical definition, fungibility is the interchangeability of a real world good or asset with another individual good or asset of the same type. For example, if you burrow a $10 note, you will pay back most probably with a different $10 note, or you could do it even with two $5 notes. On the other hand, non-fungible assets have specific characteristics. The 3 main ones are:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul><li>Uniqueness with a permanent unalterable record</li><li>Scarcity and rareness in availability</li><li>Indivisibility</li></ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>NFTs with such characteristics could gain their value through that uniqueness. For example, a plane ticket is unique. Even though it may look the same, it has different destinations, names, class, seat number, etc. One ticket may send you to New York first class, another one may be a trip to Milwaukee in economy. The same applies to a piece of art or collectible unique card.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>“With my interest in music and artists, I see the NFTs could offer a very tangible benefit to the artists in protecting their IPR, whilst creating a specific token for them and their music. In this way, if all artists list their IPR based assets, they would protect themselves from the usual bootlegging related issues, currently experienced via the various torrent sites. However, the major benefit comes from being paid immediately rather than waiting for record companies or streaming ones like Spotify, who pay you annually,” commented <a href=\\\"https://lobreauserge.com/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">Serge Maurice Lobreau</a>, Chairman and Founder of <a href=\\\"https://sapiangroup.com/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">Sapian Group</a> and of <a href=\\\"https://flashgroup.io/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">Flash Group</a>.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>Non-fungible tokens might be the next hot thing in crypto</strong></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Last few months, <a href=\\\"https://flashgroupnews.com/2020/11/12/the-defi-phenomenon-value-benefits-and-negative-aspects/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">DeFi</a> has taken the industry by a storm. However, NFTs have taken a major lead as the way forward for a token, that can be used for anything that is distinct and unique in features. Non-fungible tokens are digital collectibles,&nbsp;usually linked&nbsp;to&nbsp;a specific asset. They are tokenised versions of assets, similar to stablecoins, but not entirely the same. Unlike Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies, which have a supply of a certain number of identical coins, NFTs have individual characteristics that make them unique. They are used to represent a variety of non-fungible assets such as real estate, digital artwork, virtual collectibles, event tickets, gaming, virtual assets, real world assets, and much more.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Non-fungible tokens are cryptographic tokens that can’t be replicated, can’t be counterfeited, can’t be printed on demand and they have ownership guarantees as Bitcoin. They are different from the typical cryptocurrencies, as they are unique, rare and indivisible. They can be used to prove the ownership of digital items or physical assets like a unique authentication certificate for a piece of art, or limited edition of watches, or music records. Other tokens are fungible, in the same way as coins or banknotes, hence fungible tokens are interchangeable, the same way as a US dollar note, while non-fungible tokens can’t be replaced by something identical. NFTs cannot be split into smaller denominations, hence it is not possible to send a fraction of an NFT, the same way you would do with a fungible token.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>NFT – a dream or history in the making?</strong></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The NFT market is already $400 million, and projected to increase by 50% by the end of 2020 in value. However, the estimation is not even by far as crazy as the growth of the <a href=\\\"https://flashgroupnews.com/2020/10/14/what-is-the-future-centralised-finance-cefi-or-decentralised-finance-defi/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">DeFi</a> sector in 2020, from $665 million to $4.2 billion. NFTs have the potential to fuel an even bigger growth of the DeFi space. The technology and platforms that bring real life assets into this ecosystem already exist and they are running. This way, new people and businesses will come into the crypto ecosystem. NFTs can solve many issues that are now in many industries. Thus, digital and real-life assets can be easy to transfer, while buyers can have proof of ownership and authenticity, offering the certainty that what they get is what they paid for.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>“We’ve just started to see the amazing effects of DeFi tokens, where the vast majority have had similar drops like in the ICO days of over 70% already, like most startups do. In the NFT world, the price of the token based on the uniqueness of the token, its rareness and potential gain due to its limited supply gives ownership of the asset to the client. At Sapian Group, we are developing an extremely unique NFT that not only meets these criteria, but also combines the benefits of DeFi and yield farming in particular. Watch this space for more news on the already developed extension to the Masternode staking rewards program recently launched. We believe NFTs can unlock even more opportunities within our existing ecosystem,” commented Mru Patel, CEO and Partner at Sapian Group and COO and Partner at Flash Group.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>NFT use cases</strong></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>ERC-721 are non-fungible tokens, while ERC-1155 combines the benefits of fungible and non-fungible tokens together. The most popular applications for NFTs include virtual games like CryptoKitties and Decentraland. However, it’s already being tried at an early stage in the insurance and financial sector as well. A lot of the major thought leaders in the space have said that financial primates such as borrowing, landing, yield generation and insurance are usually performed by locking, staking, depositing and using as collateral the ERC-20 tokens like YFI, Dai, Link, Land, to name a few. But let’s get into even more ways that non-fungible tokens can be used.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>Art and entertainment</strong></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>For example, art is a major domain where NFTs would make a great difference. It’s not easy for digital artists to protect their copyright, but blockchain ends that nightmare and makes art one of the most popular applications for NFTs. It also offers proof of ownership for the buyers and makes the whole process simpler. Digital art auctions are more and more common, with paintings that were sold at spectacular prices. NFTs can also protect filmmakers and musicians against copyright infringement and connect artists directly with consumers through blockchain-based payment solutions.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>Collectibles</strong></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Collectibles have the highest sales volume on NFTs. For example, CryptoKitties, a game where users breed and collect digital cats, is one of the largest NFT-collectible projects in terms of sales volume since 2017. The Dragon CryptoKittie still holds the record for the most expensive non-fungible token ever sold. She was worth 600 ETH, representing $170.000 at the time of sale. Cryptopunks, another collectible NFT, was one of the earliest ones created that goes for a fortune. New types of collectibles are created through NFTs, such as tokenised versions of celebrities or sports stars, but real-world items like stamps or coins are also tokenised.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>Gaming</strong></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Gaming is a massive market of 2.5 billion players. NFTs are a popular trend in gaming, as blockchain allows players to gain ownership of their in-game items and enables them to earn real money by playing their favourite games. Blockchain games have become more and more popular, especially after the COVID-19 lockdown, and people continue to embrace blockchain games. Gods Unchained is a pioneer in trading card games, which is a simple yet very powerful in game trading card, with a use case that holds different powers within a game. Games like Six Dragons, Age of Rust are now long awaited for such reasons of use cases that could bring massive adoption.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>Why are we the most secure and Unique Financial NFT in the making on the market?</strong></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>“Sapian Group, with all its subsidiaries, are exploring ways to create a unique NFT that capitalises on such use cases and increases the utility of its OZTG coin, as well as the OZeety <a href=\\\"https://flashgroupnews.com/2020/11/01/an-insight-into-blockchain-and-asset-pegged-technologies-interview-with-serge-maurice-lobreau/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">blockchain</a>. We bring the best of breed from all past investment experiences of the partners namely banking, wealth management, property investment, fund management, crypto currency, blockchain, DeFi and NFT,” summarised Serge Maurice Lobreau.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>“What we have is an established <a href=\\\"https://flashgroupnews.com/2020/08/20/i-think-that-cryptocurrencies-and-blockchain-are-the-future-brock-pierce/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">blockchain</a> that already demonstrates such key characteristics of NFTs like real world assets, uniqueness with pool of Masternodes for ownership, a utility token and ecosystem&nbsp; model with growing base of a community, rarity as Masternodes will not be available forever, as ownership is indivisible, to name a few key market differentiators. However, with our total ecosystem of products and services, we are in the process of creating an even more unique super NFT that will be something of a gamechanger. It will bring the best of DeFi, crypto, blockchain, yield farming and a much bigger use case side of our core business,” concluded Mru Patel.</p>\\n\",\"protected\":false},\"excerpt\":{\"rendered\":\"<p>Author: Georgiana Dogaru Decentralised finance (DeFi) has been the talk of the town throughout 2020, but it wasn’t the only sector in the space that gained traction.

The economy in such countries is struggling to recover. These consist of several African countries, war stricken countries like Syria, Iran, Iraq, Afghanistan, Lebanon, various South American countries like Venezuela and Paraguay, to name but a few.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>The rule of banks – a painful lesson</strong><strong></strong></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Let’s look at Lebanon as one of the latest economically hit for the moment. It is classified as a developing, upper-middle income economy, with a nominal GDP estimated at $54.1 billion in 2018 and a per capita GDP amounting to $12,000. The Lebanese financial system is dominated by banks. Lebanon’s banks have been seen as the most important part of the country’s economy for decades. From 2011 to 2019 their combined assets had increased 83%, reaching a staggering $253B. That equals almost five times the country’s economic output.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>But from a lavish life in big glass buildings, now bankers are hiding in branches barricaded with thick metal plates to protect them from protesters and firebombs. Since March, a crisis has accelerated in Lebanon that affects the economic, fiscal and monetary sectors, with a government debt of $90B. Lebanon’s exports are very little and imports are high, while its economy is burdened by one of the world’s largest debts. Inflation increased to 56.5 % in May, and in June protesters started fires outside the central bank’s office in Tripoli. On the walls in Beirut, it’s written “down with the rule of bank”.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\\\"wp-block-image size-large\\\"><a href=\\\"https://flashgroup.io/\\\"><img loading=\\\"lazy\\\" width=\\\"1024\\\" height=\\\"1024\\\" src=\\\"https://flashgroupnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/WhatsApp-Image-2020-09-22-at-22.44.05.jpeg\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"wp-image-2786\\\" srcset=\\\"https://flashgroupnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/WhatsApp-Image-2020-09-22-at-22.44.05.jpeg 1024w, https://flashgroupnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/WhatsApp-Image-2020-09-22-at-22.44.05-640x640.jpeg 640w, https://flashgroupnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/WhatsApp-Image-2020-09-22-at-22.44.05-160x160.jpeg 160w, https://flashgroupnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/WhatsApp-Image-2020-09-22-at-22.44.05-120x120.jpeg 120w, https://flashgroupnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/WhatsApp-Image-2020-09-22-at-22.44.05-360x360.jpeg 360w, https://flashgroupnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/WhatsApp-Image-2020-09-22-at-22.44.05-80x80.jpeg 80w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\\\" /></a><figcaption>www.flashgroup.io</figcaption></figure>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>Lebanon’s burdened economy</strong><strong></strong></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>“With very few sources of foreign exchange, Lebanon depends almost entirely on its diaspora to send cash to the banking system, which is then converted to finance imports and the state deficit. This now is hindered by all the current deflationary exchange rates that are offered for any local currency conversion,” highlights <a rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\" href=\\\"https://lobreauserge.com\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">Serge Maurice Lobreau</a>, Chairman and Founder of <a href=\\\"https://sapiangroup.com/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">Sapian Group</a> and <a rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\" href=\\\"https://flashgroup.io/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">Flash Group</a>.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>For several years in a row, the economic growth has been between 1-2%, but in 2019 has fallen to zero. Despite the economic problems, the government continued to borrow. The economic chaos is a result of years of corruption, inefficiency and waste. People blame bankers and politicians for the increasing poverty and unemployment rate. The system has been mainly against people and pro banks, helping banks generate huge profits, until the system broke down. The total losses estimated across the banking sector are at $69B, with the central bank alone having $50B in losses.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Lenders have set limits on withdrawals and those who owned dollars bank account cannot exchange it on the international rates (up to 50% devaluation). This way, people are forced to pay everything in local currency. Also, no one can send money outside the country. The scarcity of dollars led to a weak Lebanese pound which made the exchange prices go up. Even the state owned mobile operators are expensive.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>Corruption and riots</strong><strong></strong></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Hence, the Lebanese people have started to call the dollar they have “Lollar”. A Lollar is a US dollar that is stuck in the Lebanese banking system. It is just a computer entry with no corresponding currency. The term was coined by Harvard economic fellow Dan Azzi, an Advanced Leadership fellow at Harvard University,&nbsp;after the severe economic crisis in Lebanon.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The protesters have accused the political elite of exploiting the state resources for their own benefits and for the people in their inner circles.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Lebanon is not a typical Arab country. Unlike other Arab states, Lebanon doesn’t have one ruler, but many leaders and political parties, and there are people saying that the system has kept the ruling cast in power for decades and allowed politicians to put their own interest above those of the people and the state. Because of corruption and lack of reform, the political system brought the economy into a desperate situation that made people riot out in the streets and ask for serious changes in their country.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The current issue is highlighted by a recent conversation with a local friend who wishes to be anonymous. He recently tried to exchange his locally stored Dollars in the bank to convert to cash and was offered 50% of the value. Furthermore, due to the large sum involved, his bank account got blocked, so he cannot even have access to his own hard earned cash savings until next year. There are several people in such situations. The people outside the country seriously need to consider alternative banking solutions. The Fintech and <a href=\\\"http://FlashGroup.io\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">DeFi</a> space is disrupting the traditional banking space specifically for such reasons, where central governments and banks control where, how and how much you get for your cash. A sad situation we have seen in many parts of the world. It is for this reason why the Fintech and <a href=\\\"http://FlashGroup.io\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">DeFi</a> market is taking off.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\\\"wp-block-image size-large\\\"><img loading=\\\"lazy\\\" width=\\\"1280\\\" height=\\\"853\\\" src=\\\"https://flashgroupnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/oztcard_newsletter-1280x853.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"wp-image-2779\\\" srcset=\\\"https://flashgroupnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/oztcard_newsletter-1280x853.jpg 1280w, https://flashgroupnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/oztcard_newsletter-640x427.jpg 640w, https://flashgroupnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/oztcard_newsletter-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://flashgroupnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/oztcard_newsletter-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://flashgroupnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/oztcard_newsletter.jpg 2048w, https://flashgroupnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/oztcard_newsletter-360x240.jpg 360w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px\\\" /><figcaption>https://flashgroup.io/</figcaption></figure>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>Technology is the answer</strong><strong></strong></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>With the advent of the Blockchain and digital currencies taking the world by storm, one solution the citizens can deploy is to adopt a full digital currency ecosystem. The diaspora has several solutions at hand that are significantly better than all major traditional banks. “Imagine getting a better interest on your funds, full access globally at interbanking rates, spend at will from your digital wallet, exchange the funds to any Fiat or digital currency, have an associated debit card that you can spend at merchants and so on. The <a rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\" href=\\\"https://flashgroup.io/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">Flash Group</a>’s solution offers such flexibility and keeps you in control of your finances,” explained Mru Patel, partner and CEO of <a href=\\\"https://sapiangroup.com/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">Sapian Group</a> Ltd and COO of <a rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\" href=\\\"https://flashgroup.io/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">Flash Group</a> Ltd. “The <a rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\" href=\\\"https://www.flashxchanger.com/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">FlashXchanger</a>, FlashWallet (fully licensed financial institution, digital exchange and wallet), virtual and biometric digital card, cryptostations for depositing cash to buy crypto are the solutions that help transition to a decentralized financial system. Furthermore, you can join the Masternode staking and farming program, whereby you get over 400% assured returns per year staking your funds for 1 year in a locked Masternode yield farm. You have the flexibility to spend the earned staking rewards of the <a rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\" href=\\\"https://www.ozeety.com/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">OZTG </a>for your daily consumption via the <a rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\" href=\\\"https://flashxchanger.com\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">FlashXchanger</a>, to convert to any fiat and most popular crypto currencies,” further added Mru Patel.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>“You could also have the use of the wallet held coins and fiat to spend when you visit Lebanon, or simply issue a support card for your loved ones back home. Diaspora citizens with bank accounts in other countries simply download the flash wallet, exchange and optionally chose to purchase the Masternode passive income licence to benefit from the high yield to support free spending at interbanking rates. So all the exchange losses made in the conversion can be recovered within a few months, whilst enrolling onto our wallet and Masternode rewards program,” added <a href=\\\"https://lobreauserge.com\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">Serge Maurice Lobreau</a>.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>For more information, visit <a href=\\\"https://flashgroup.io/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">www.flashgroup.io</a></p>\\n\",\"protected\":false},\"excerpt\":{\"rendered\":\"<p>The world has seen several countries over the past three decades virtually lose the value of their currencies against the major dominant ones like US dollar (over 70% of the daily $7T transactions), United Kingdom’s GBP and EU’s Euro specifically.

Mru Patel spoke alongside Nikolay Shkilev, Co-founder &amp; CEO at ZELWIN.com, Roberto Capodieci, Founder and CEO at Blockchain Zoo and Kirill Mishanin, Chief Sales Officer at EMIREX. The online event was organized and moderated by Sergey Sevantsyan, who pointed out that “DeFi is all over the globe and this mania haunts almost everyone involved in the decentralized finance ecosystem.”</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The event was centred on the recent <a href=\\\"https://flashgroupnews.com/2020/09/18/oztg-coin-and-ozeety-blockchain-proof-of-stake-with-yield-farming-is-bigger-than-defi/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">DeFi</a> boom, trying to see if it’s a bubble or an investment vehicle. Mru Patel talked about DeFi issues and highlighted solutions to the current problems in the space.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>According to Mru Patel, the current issues with over 95% of the DeFi coins are the following: trust, very similar business models and most of them are copied, majority don’t even publish a whitepaper which makes it worse than ICO days, and most of DeFi project founders have no experience to run a sustainable business. Also, majority do not have any real asset/collateral/security and they have complicated models, systems and procedures. Another downside to DeFi is that there is limited reporting for the trade, history and purchase prices, unless it’s listed on a traditional CEX.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>“In the ICO days there were few written pages of whitepapers and people raised millions based on that. That’s one of the reasons it fell down and got a bad name, because a lot of scammers and bad actors came in and that’s what happens. Unfortunately, I feel the same way happening in the DeFi space,” said Mru Patel.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The DeFi space has already created a controversial name around it. Lately, the name DeFi seems to be integrated in almost any blockchain project, even though most of the solutions offered are hardly revolutionary decentralised finance.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>“We’ve already seen a number of, dare I say scams, Ponzi schemes, where people casually just do more of the same. I really don’t see many unique propositions out there. I see people trying to do simple staking types of projects, call them all sorts of names, and you never see who is behind it. And you never see what their motives are, what the value proposition in terms of the business is, how they take it forward and how are they’re going forward.”</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>On the other hand, there are a few solution tips that can help differentiate good projects from the ones with no value and no future. Investors should look out forpublic domain information about the coin, company, team, community and any form of a pre-launch liquidity from trusted sources or other investors who did due diligence. It should also be easy to see why they are different and other USPs, especially if they have real products or proved delivery like masternodes, staking implementations, wallet, exchange or other real products and services.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>“We have in our group ATMs, but we call them cryptostations. So you can actually go in there and educate yourself about what is happening in the crypto space. Also, if you want to enter into the crypto space and you don’t have a fixed address to do the proof of ID, you can enter your details, put some money in and buy crypto. Even more importantly, one of our other products is a biometric smart card with a fingerprint. One of these cards is a 4GB cold storage with an all in one function: you can onboard other cards, but also do crypto and fiat transactions,” said Mru Patel.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Mru further presented the <a href=\\\"https://flashgroup.io/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">Flash Group</a> ecosystem, which has a privacy based token. Deploying this technology, <a href=\\\"https://flashgroup.io/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">Flash Group</a> uses the EShadow protocol with other extensions (called Ezee) in their Blockchain.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>“It’s very difficult to hack through the Ezee protocol, let alone know the identities as well. And on the back of that blockchain, we have a whole masternode staking program and we are doing it as a licence. You buy a licence for masternodes, just like Dash and Ethereum offer masternode programs”.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Other criterion for choosing a DeFi project is how much liquidity is collected. Sometimes it’s not a good sign if you are the first investor. Also, don’t go for big 10,000% + yield plays.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>“What we’ve created is a very unique masternode package. Our <a href=\\\"https://www.ozeety.com\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">coin </a>is pegged against gold. We have over $100M worth of gold, secured in a vault, and we use that for pegging our gold coin, the <a href=\\\"https://www.ozeety.com\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">OZTG</a>. And in that coin now what we do is we ensure you don’t see the volatility of the crypto or the market sensitivity or the whales disrupting the price of the coin. We have intrinsic value and the true market value, and there in it we play our stability game. So, in our market, I don’t see anyone assuring and pegged at those levels that I’ve just talked at over 400%,” said Mru Patel.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The core of <a href=\\\"https://flashgroup.io/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">Flash Group</a> and <a href=\\\"https://sapiangroup.com/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">Sapian Group</a> ecosystem is their challenge of “defying DeFi and beyond” with real products and services.

The way information is communicated can create trust. If DeFi is a bubble or the beginning of a revolution only time will tell. Our society needs decentralised finances, but it also needs serious people involved in this process and serious products and services, that solve major problems that people have to face every day.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>For the full video of the event, please visit our <a href=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCAPeeOvrOVzz8xsEyy2pLzA\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">Flash Group YouTube</a> channel or access the link below:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\\\"wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\\\"><div class=\\\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\\\">\\n<iframe title=\\\"DeFitalks - exploring decentralized finances DeFi tools LIVESTREAM 09 09 2020\\\" width=\\\"696\\\" height=\\\"392\\\" src=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/nagzE_a4qVM?feature=oembed&#038;enablejsapi=1\\\" frameborder=\\\"0\\\" allow=\\\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\\\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\\n</div></figure>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>For more information about the ecosystem of products and services created by Flash Group and Sapian Group, you can visit <a href=\\\"http://www.flashgroup.io/\\\">www.flashgroup.io</a></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Now think DeFi and Beyond!</p>\\n\",\"protected\":false},\"excerpt\":{\"rendered\":\"<p>Mru Patel, Partner and COO of Flash Group and CEO of Sapian Group, was a speaker at the online event DeFitalks – exploring decentralized finances DeFi tools.

Ethereum developers have announced the release of a &#8220;validator launchpad&#8221; on the upcoming Medalla testnet. The purpose is to educate and prepare future validators. The transition requires re-engineering the Ethereum platform and launching a new, more scalable version. As stated on their <a href=\\\"https://blog.ethereum.org/2020/07/27/eth2-validator-launchpad/\\\" rel=\\\"noopener noreferrer\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">blog</a>:</p>\\n<blockquote><p>“The idea behind the launchpad is to make the process of becoming an eth2 validator as easy as possible, without compromising on security and education.”</p></blockquote>\\n<p><strong>The Three Stages Of Eth2</strong><br />\\nAccording to ethereum.org, eth2 will be released in several phases:</p>\\n<blockquote><p>“Transitioning from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake, eth2 will be launched in at least 3 phases. The idea is to break up this transition into phases each focusing on a different aspect of eth2.<br />\\nPhase 0 contains all of the machinery behind eth2’s consensus, it tracks the validators and their balances.<br />\\nPhase 1 handles adding and storing the data associated with eth2.<br />\\nPhase 2 adds execution on eth2 which enables programmers to be run on top of it.”</p></blockquote>\\n<p>The Launchpad comes before phase 0 and enables validators to track and deposit test stakes on the Medalla multi-client testnet.</p>\\n<p><strong>Proof-of-Stake vs. Proof-of-Work</strong><br />\\nEth 2 seeks to decentralise and speed up the network, hence it shifts from proof-of-work (PoW) to proof-of-stake (PoS). Ethereum has operated a proof-of-work consensus, but proof-of-stake is generally considered to be far more energy-efficient and more cost-effective than mining.<br />\\nThe transition to PoS should improve Ethereum&#8217;s scalability issues and its inability to handle a large quantity of transactions under PoW.<br />\\nIn PoW, miners validate transactions through complex math solved by computer hardware and add them to a data block in a series, or chain, that is cryptographically secured.<br />\\nIn PoS, a person can mine or validate block transactions according to how many coins they hold. Hence, the more coins owned by a miner, the more mining power he or she has.</p>\\n<p><strong>The Ethereum 2.0 Staking</strong><br />\\nThe process of staking involves receiving rewards after locking up an amount of a given cryptocurrency in a wallet to participate in the operation of a blockchain. Anyone can participate in staking on any blockchain that operates a proof-of-stake consensus. To participate in Ethereum’s staking process, there will be a minimum threshold of 32 ETH. Also, validators will need to be running a validator node.<br />\\nEthereum’s core developers are heavily in favor of decentralization, which could be one of the main reasons for moving to PoS.</p>\\n\",\"protected\":false},\"excerpt\":{\"rendered\":\"<p>The transition to Ethereum 2.0 and its proof-of-stake consensus mechanism has started.

It also is cold storage, a feature that ensures safety of fiat and crypto currencies&#8217; wallets     Remittance services (FlashRemitt) allowing instant transfer of crypto/fiat currencies     Exchange platform (FlashXchanger) for cryptocurrencies and 180 fiat currencies\\n</ul>\\n<p>In addition to Flashmoni&#8217;s tools, the company offers two gold-backed tokens at the center of its financial ecosystem:</p>\\n<p>    OZG is a private, non-tradable token directly backed by physical 24k gold that will be stored in a depository and audited quarterly by an independent and internationally known audit firm. This is a security coin that will not be available to the public, but ensures the system&#8217;s stability.<br />\\n    OZTG is a tradable utility token backed by OZG, meaning its core value is also backed by gold. It is available to the public and will be found on exchanges including <a href=\\\"https://www.flashxchanger.com/\\\" rel=\\\"noopener noreferrer\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">FlashXchanger</a>.\\n</ul>\\n<p>OZG&#8217;s value is equivalent to 1 grain of gold, or about 0.065 grams, and will not fluctuate with market movements, as it is not available on public exchanges. OZTG&#8217;s price will fluctuate based on trading, however, its price will never fall below 1/20 of OZG&#8217;s value. Unlike the majority of tokens on the market, OZT has a core value because it is backed by the amount of gold the company has stored.</p>\\n<p>During Phase 1 of Flashmoni&#8217;s crowdsale, the company raised $62 million U.S. Dollars. There are still approximately 141 million OZT tokens remaining, with a hard cap of $100 million.</p>\\n<p>Flashmoni will be able to keep rates and fees low by focusing on its advertising solution as its primary generator of revenue. Its blockchain advertising solution (FlashAdChain) boasts smart contracts and ensures fully transparent advertising rates.</p>\\n<p>Flashmoni is based in Lisbon with offices in London, Singapore and Dubai. Prior to launching its ICO, the Flashmoni&#8217;s leadership team bootstrapped the initial development of the company and its solutions, unique in the ICO-space. The ICO is closed to general investors in the U.S.</p>\\n<p>About Flashmoni<br />\\nFlashmoni is a blockchain company built for financial inclusion. As part of its comprehensive financial ecosystem, it provides banking solutions to everyone in the global community – most importantly the unbanked and underbanked. Flashmoni&#8217;s ecosystem can be divided into three essential components: Cryptocurrency tokens, tools for the unbanked/underbanked and advertising solutions. Specifically, it offers a utility gold-backed token and its tools include physical crypto ATMs, multi-currencies digital wallets, a fiat and cryptocurrency exchange platform, a smart-card used for payments and remittance services. Additionally, Flashmoni has created an advertising solution featuring smart contracts, which serves as its primary source of revenue and allows it to keep fees and costs at a minimum.</p>\\n<p>For the original version on PRWeb visit: http://www.prweb.com/releases/2018/04/prweb15399228.htm</p>\\n\",\"protected\":false},\"excerpt\":{\"rendered\":\"<p>Flashmoni&#8217;s financial ecosystem set to include several services for unbanked and underbanked, Company raised $62 million USD in phase one.

Ethereum developers have announced the release of a &#8220;validator launchpad&#8221; on the upcoming Medalla testnet. The purpose is to educate and prepare future validators. The transition requires re-engineering the Ethereum platform and launching a new, more scalable version. As stated on their <a href=\\\"https://blog.ethereum.org/2020/07/27/eth2-validator-launchpad/\\\" rel=\\\"noopener noreferrer\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">blog</a>:</p>\\n<blockquote><p>“The idea behind the launchpad is to make the process of becoming an eth2 validator as easy as possible, without compromising on security and education.”</p></blockquote>\\n<p><strong>The Three Stages Of Eth2</strong><br />\\nAccording to ethereum.org, eth2 will be released in several phases:</p>\\n<blockquote><p>“Transitioning from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake, eth2 will be launched in at least 3 phases. The idea is to break up this transition into phases each focusing on a different aspect of eth2.<br />\\nPhase 0 contains all of the machinery behind eth2’s consensus, it tracks the validators and their balances.<br />\\nPhase 1 handles adding and storing the data associated with eth2.<br />\\nPhase 2 adds execution on eth2 which enables programmers to be run on top of it.”</p></blockquote>\\n<p>The Launchpad comes before phase 0 and enables validators to track and deposit test stakes on the Medalla multi-client testnet.</p>\\n<p><strong>Proof-of-Stake vs. Proof-of-Work</strong><br />\\nEth 2 seeks to decentralise and speed up the network, hence it shifts from proof-of-work (PoW) to proof-of-stake (PoS). Ethereum has operated a proof-of-work consensus, but proof-of-stake is generally considered to be far more energy-efficient and more cost-effective than mining.<br />\\nThe transition to PoS should improve Ethereum&#8217;s scalability issues and its inability to handle a large quantity of transactions under PoW.<br />\\nIn PoW, miners validate transactions through complex math solved by computer hardware and add them to a data block in a series, or chain, that is cryptographically secured.<br />\\nIn PoS, a person can mine or validate block transactions according to how many coins they hold. Hence, the more coins owned by a miner, the more mining power he or she has.</p>\\n<p><strong>The Ethereum 2.0 Staking</strong><br />\\nThe process of staking involves receiving rewards after locking up an amount of a given cryptocurrency in a wallet to participate in the operation of a blockchain. Anyone can participate in staking on any blockchain that operates a proof-of-stake consensus. To participate in Ethereum’s staking process, there will be a minimum threshold of 32 ETH. Also, validators will need to be running a validator node.<br />\\nEthereum’s core developers are heavily in favor of decentralization, which could be one of the main reasons for moving to PoS.</p>\\n\",\"protected\":false},\"excerpt\":{\"rendered\":\"<p>The transition to Ethereum 2.0 and its proof-of-stake consensus mechanism has started.
